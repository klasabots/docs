Klasa is a 'plug-and-play' framework built on top of the Discord.js library.
Most of the code is modularized, which allows developers to edit Klasa to suit their needs.

Some features of Klasa include:
• Fast loading times with ES2017 support (async/await)
• Per-client/guild/user settings that can be extended with your own fields
• Customizable command system with automated parameter resolving and the ability to load/reload commands on-the-fly
• "Monitors", which can watch messages and edits (for swear filters, spam protection, etc.)
• "Inhibitors", which can prevent commands from running based on any condition you wish to apply (for permissions, blacklists, etc.)
• "Providers", which simplify usage of any database of your choosing
• "Finalizers", which run after successful commands (for logging, collecting stats, cleaning up responses, etc.)
• "Extendables", which passively add methods, getters/setters, or static properties to existing Discord.js or Klasa classes
• "Languages", which allow you to localize your bot's responses
• "Tasks", which can be scheduled to run in the future, optionally repeating

We hope to be a 100% customizable framework that can cater to all audiences. We do frequent updates and bugfixes when available.
